    <h1>Chili Dog Mac and Cheese</h1>
    <img src="../images/chili-mac.webp">
    <p>I can’t really explain why I decided to create this chili dog mac
         and cheese hybrid. I always get a few requests for comforting
          casseroles this time of year, but if the goal was to end up with
           a recipe that tasted like both things, I failed miserably. 
           On the other hand, if a tasty, comforting casserole was the
            mission, then let’s celebrate…and invite a few friends, since 
            this thing is huge.</p>
    <p>While I did enjoy eating this, I was a bit confused why it didn’t
         really taste like chili dogs or mac and cheese. I knew the lack 
         of creamy sauce might be an issue, but I thought if I stirred in 
         enough cheese, all would be fine. Taste and texture-wise, I was 
         correct, but the flavors just didn’t come together as I’d hoped. 
         Anyway, I tried, and failed, but also kind of succeeded, and if 
         you’d like something that feels and tastes like an American 
         goulash with hot dogs, then I really do hope you give this a try 
         soon. Enjoy!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1lb ground beef</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>3 tbsp chili powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 cup diced green peppers</li>
        <li>1lb hot dogs, sliced</li>
        <li>28 oz crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2.5 cups water</li>
        <li>2 cups macaroni</li>
        <li>8 ounces shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>8 ounces shredded Monterey jack cheese</li>
        <li>green onions, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add olive oil to a large pot and place over high heat. Add beef; cook and stir, breaking up with a spoon or spatula, about 2 minutes. Add onions and salt, and cook, stirring, until beef is crumbly, and onions turn translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the chili powder, cumin, paprika, black pepper, cinnamon, cayenne, dried oregano, and garlic. Cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add peppers, sliced hot dogs, crushed tomatoes, and water. Stir together; bring the mixture to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until cooked to your taste, at least 30 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning.</li>
        <li>Once chili is nearly ready, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in macaroni and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, 1 minute less than specified in package directions, until not quite tender, and still firm to the bite, about 8 to 11 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Turn off heat under chili, drain macaroni, and add to the pot of chili. Stir until combined, and transfer mixture into a large, deep (15x10-inch) baking dish.</li>
        <li>Mix Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses together in a bowl, and transfer about 60% of cheese to top of chili mixture. Use a spoon to thoroughly mix cheese into the casserole.</li>
        <li>Apply remaining cheese evenly over the top, and lightly poke down into the surface with the tip of a spoon.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Let rest 15 minutes before serving, topped with green onions.</li>
    </ol>
