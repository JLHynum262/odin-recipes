# odin-recipes

    In this lesson, I'm going to be building an HTML website for recipes.
I'll be testing all the HTML code I know so far, including starting 
from scratch, making lists, headings, and maybe adding links and photos.
The hardest part for me will be remembering how to commit to Git and
interact with Github during the process, as that has so far been
separate during my lessons.
