    In this lesson, I'm going to be building an HTML website for recipes.
I'll be testing all the HTML code I know so far, including starting 
from scratch, making lists, headings, and maybe adding links and photos.
The hardest part for me will be remembering how to commit to Git and
interact with Github during the process, as that has so far been
separate during my lessons.

    I'll now be updating the website with CSS elements. Or, actually, I
already started, but now I also want to update the core reason for the
site, which will entail changing some html elements as well to account for
making this more themed and fun than just a generic recipe site. I'm
thinking cursed recipes... and maybe also a few that are just slightly
poisonous. Not enough to kill but maybe enough to have a laxative effect.
Just in case you need that. For constipation. Your own constipation. No
one else's. Why would you use it any other way?
And then I'm also still trying to make git commits a muscle memory thing
instead of a I-need-to-look-this-up-every-time thing.
